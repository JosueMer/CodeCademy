// My current age

let earlyYears = 2;

// same with laterYears, it will be changing just like earlyYears
let laterYears = myAge - 2;
// Multiply the laterYears variable by 4 to calculate the number of dog years
laterYears *= 4;

// Add earlyYears and laterYears together and store in a new variable
