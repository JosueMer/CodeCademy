What I am learning in Codecademy

Learning JavaScript first was hard for me since I have never done coding. Learned how the Console in JavaScript works. 
For those of you that don't know the console is a panel that displays important messages. For example errors, for developers much of the work the computer does
with our code is invisible to us by default. To be able to see it we can print or log in to our console directly.
